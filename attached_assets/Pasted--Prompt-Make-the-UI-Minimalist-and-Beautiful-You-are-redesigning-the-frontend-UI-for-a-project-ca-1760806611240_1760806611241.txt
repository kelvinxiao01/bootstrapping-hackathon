🎨 Prompt: Make the UI Minimalist and Beautiful
You are redesigning the frontend UI for a project called CRO Recruiter, built in Next.js.
The purpose of the app is to help call agents and coordinators manage patient recruitment for clinical trials.
The backend (Python) handles all the logic — your focus is purely frontend design and experience.
🧭 Design Goals
Make the interface clean, minimal, and modern — inspired by tools like Linear, Notion, and Airtable.
Prioritize readability, whitespace, and calm colors.
The UI should feel professional, medical-grade, but approachable.
Use subtle animations and microinteractions (hover states, transitions) to make the experience feel alive.
Avoid clutter, boxes, or harsh borders. Use soft shadows and smooth edges instead.
🧱 Layout Overview
Navigation Bar (Top)
Thin, translucent header with the app name “CRO Recruiter”.
Right corner: buttons for “Import Patients” and “Filter”.
A soft accent color (light teal or medical blue) for action buttons.
Dashboard (Main Section)
Display patients in a clean table or grid, similar to Notion or Airtable.
Each row = patient; each column = key info (Name, Age, Diagnosis, Score, Status).
Use subtle color chips for status:
Green: Eligible
Red: Ineligible
Amber: Needs Info
Rounded corners, light divider lines, no full boxes.
Side Panel (Patient Detail View)
Slide-in panel from the right when clicking a patient.
Large readable text, soft spacing, icons for criteria.
Buttons: “Recalculate Eligibility,” “Start Call,” and “Mark Status.”
Keep consistent accent color for all CTAs.
Import Modal
Clean drag-and-drop area with dotted border.
Upload icon + short instruction text (“Drop your CSV here or click to browse”).
Minimal success/fail indicators (checkmark or subtle red X).
🎨 Style Guide
Font: Inter, Manrope, or Plus Jakarta Sans (whichever looks best).
Colors:
Background: #F9FAFB (off-white)
Text: #111827 (dark gray)
Subtext: #6B7280 (muted gray)
Accent: #0EA5E9 (light medical blue)
Success: #10B981 (green)
Error: #EF4444 (soft red)
Warning: #F59E0B (amber)
Borders: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.05)
Shadows: Soft, layered; no harsh contrast.
Radius: 12–16px on modals and panels.
Buttons: Rounded, filled accent color, hover → subtle lift.
💡 Interactions
Hovering over rows or buttons gives a gentle lift or glow.
Table cells animate slightly when updated (like Google Sheets).
Smooth transitions between pages or panels.
Loading states use skeleton placeholders (light gray shimmer).
🪄 What to Generate
Full redesigned layout in Next.js pages and components.
Include clean CSS or Tailwind styling for the theme above.
Replace the old layout with a minimalist design that fits any screen.
Keep everything ready to connect to backend APIs (no breaking structure).
🧘 Vibe Summary
Think:
“Notion meets Clinical Research.”
Calm, data-driven, yet human.
Whitespace is luxury — use it.
End of prompt.
Build the frontend following this exact tone and design direction.
Every element should feel purposeful, light, and harmonious.
